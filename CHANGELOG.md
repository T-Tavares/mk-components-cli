# MK-COMPONETNT-CLI

## Version

Versions before 1.1.0 are mainly me testing and getting used to npm packages publishing and how it work. So at this point is safer to just go with v1.1.0

@latest v1.1.1

## Changes

That's the MVP version of MK Component CLI / MK CLI

#### v1.1.1

Refactoring on Core functions.

## Known Issues

The configuration file path wasn't fully tested at this point because I only have easy access to MacOS. I did everything to assure the path is read properly, but you know.. Testing is King.

Let me know if anything weird show up on your end and I'll do my best to fix it asap.
